# My Nixos Config
**I started using nixos because it doesn't break due to network failure and incomplete updates, it's weird that most package managers don't have much protection against incomplete downloads, they slowly kill themselves along with the entire system ,hence nix is the very good choice for its recovery features, still you would need to deal with its immutable system design **.This is a very minimum nix config you can just copy the configuration file and get a working machine with all the basic programs available.
